# Overview
A talk for the FFconf conference.

| Length | 40m |

## Abstract
Memory is fundamentally important to any computer program. It's a finite resource, and is limited on mobile devices more than it is on desktop. JavaScript does a remarkable job of hiding this complexity from us. What's going on behind the scenes, and how can you fix problems when memory runs out?

In this talk I will introduce computer memory and how JavaScript's garbage collector works. I will contrast JavaScript with other languages and explore how Web Assembly will change the web's relationship with memory in the future. It will be aimed at JavaScript developers of all experience levels and backgrounds.

## Important questions this talk must answer
- What is memory, why do we need it?
- What is garbage collection, and why does JavaScript use it?
- What is a "memory leak", and how do I fix it?
- How does JavaScript compare to other languages?
- How will Web Assembly change the way we work with memory?
