## Introduction
Memory is fundamentally important to any computer program. It is an in-demand, finite resource. As devices are given more memory, our apps discover new ways of gobbling it up.

Ten years ago, we saw the beginning of a big change in the way people use the websites we make. Devices like the iPhone and Galaxy mobile phones are now the preferred way of accessing the web. Devices like these are given a fraction of the amount of memory of desktop and laptop computers. And that's just the high-tech tip of the iceberg - the majority in use around the world have even less.

We're often told that memory is important, that you need to be mindful of the limitations of these machines. This is absolutely true. But JavaScript does such a remarkable job that, for the most part, we don't need to worry about memory. Why is that?
